  credits: 1
  preReq: Data Structures, Object-oriented programming, Theory of computation, Discrete mathematics, Algorithms
  description: Many real world problems reduce to solving a set of constraints. From time table scheduling to inventory management and fault localization to efficient resource utilization, it all ultimately boils down to expressing these problems as a set of constraints. Not only it is at the heart of most of the problems in operation research but constraint solving has applications ranging from computational biology to program analysis. These applications use the constraint solvers mostly as a black box. However, one can gain tremendously from the study of constraint solvers and the techniques they employ so as to adapt them to the problem at hand. This course will attempt to study the underlying techniques employed by modern day constraint solvers. In particular, solving techniques behind SAT, MaxSAT, Pseudo-Boolean constraint solving will be studied. In addition, this course will also attempt to take a look at SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solving.
