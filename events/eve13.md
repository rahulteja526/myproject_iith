##### **Invited Talk by Prof. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru on Social Complexity and Computing on Online Networks**
**Title:** Social Complexity and Computing on Online Networks  
**Speaker:** Prof. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru, IIIT Delhi.  
**Host Faculty:** Dr. Srijith P.K.  
**Room No:** LH-2  
**Time:** 12:00  
 
**Abstract:**

With increase in usage of the Internet, there has been an exponential increase in the use of online social media. Websites like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, Reddit, Pinterest, and Flickr have changed the way the Internet is being used. There is a dire need to investigate, measure, and understand different facets of online social media from various perspectives (computational, cultural, psychological). Large amount of data, and understanding of the behaviour on social networks can be used to address various societal problems that users face on the Internet. Real world scalable systems need to be built to reduce the impact of these problems on the users. I will describe briefly some cool projects that we work on: Spam Campaigns on Twitter, Follower Count Fallacy, I Spy With My Little Eye, #KillFies, and #BlueWhale Most of our research work is made available for public use through tools or online services. Our work derives techniques from Computational Social Science, Data Science, Statistics, Network Science, and Human Computer Interaction. I will be more than happy to clarify, discuss any of our work in detail, as required, after the talk.
