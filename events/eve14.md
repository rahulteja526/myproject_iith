**Abstract:**

 In the Cycle Packing problem, we are given an undirected graph G, a positive integer r, and the task is to determine whether there exist r vertex-disjoint cycles. Cycle Packing is one of the first problems studied in the Parameterized Complexity framework and it is well known to be fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) with respect to the solution size r. In this talk, we will discuss the parameterized complexity of Cycle Packing with respect to a structural parameter, namely, distance to proper interval graphs (indifference graphs). We will show that this problem is FPT using the color coding technique, a greedy strategy and a dynamic programming routine based on structural properties of proper interval graphs. Several structural parameterizations for Cycle Packing have been studied in the literature and our FPT algorithm fills a gap in the ecology of such parameterizations. This is joint work with Abhishek Sahu (Institute of Mathematical Sciences), Saket Saurabh (Institute of Mathematical Sciences) and Meirav Zehavi (Ben-Gurion University) and is accepted for publication at LATIN 2018 (to be held in April 2018). The talk will be self-contained.
