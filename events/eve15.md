**Title:** Multivariate Analysis of Hard Variants of Stable Marriage Problem

**Room No:** A-220, academic block A.  
**Time:** 12:00  

**Abstract:**

The stable marriage problem is a classic problem that is used in practice to model wide ranging scenarios such as matching colleges to students, kidney donors to recipients,  users to servers in a distributed internet service etc There is a polynomial time algorithm for computing a solution for the problem that is attributed to Gale and Shapley. However, there are several natural variants of the stable marriage problem that are NP-hard.  In this talk we will be discussing hard variants of the stable marriage problem from the perspective of Parameterized Complexity.
