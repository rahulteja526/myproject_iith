**Title:** Micro-services and Streaming data pipelines
**Speaker:** Dr. Souvik Ray
**Host Faculty:**  Dr. Sparsh Mittal
**Room No:** A-416, academic block A.
**Time:** 11:00-12:00
 
**Abstract:**

The modern trend in enterprises is to move from monolithic systems to decoupled and modular micro-services which communicate through lightweight protocols and messaging structures. In this talk, I will discuss how such architectures help large companies, especially in the context of big-data stack. I will also discuss how streaming data pipelines and messaging systems(e.g. Spark and Kafka) have become part and parcel of big-data stack over a wide gamut of use cases (from IOT to medicine).
