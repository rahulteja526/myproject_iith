##### **Invited Talk by Dr Matjaz Kovse on Distance matrices of partial cubes**
**Title:** Distance matrices of partial cubes
**Speaker:** Dr. Matjaz Kovse
**Host Faculty:**  Dr. N R Aravind
**Room No:** Room 117 in academic block A.
**Time:** 14:30
 
**Abstract:**

Partial cubes are isometric subgraphs of hypercubes. Median graph is a graph in which every three vertices u,v and w have a unique median: a vertex m that belongs to shortest paths between each pair of u,v and w. Median graphs present one of the most studied subclasses of partial cubes. We determine the Smith normal form of the distance matrices of partial cubes and the factorisation of Varchenko determinant of product distance matrices of median graphs.

**Speaker's Bio:**

Dr. Matjaz Kovse did his PhD in mathematics in the University of Maribor and postdocs at the Institut Fourier, Grenoble, and the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics, Leipzig. He is currently a Visiting Associate Professor in the School of Basic Sciences at the Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar.
