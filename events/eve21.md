##### **Seminar by Dr.Sparsh Mittal on "Improving clarity in paper writing"**
**Title:** Improving clarity in paper writing  
**Speaker:** Dr. Sparsh Mittal  

**Abstract:**

Talk on "Improving Clarity In Paper Writing" - This talk provides many tips for effectively conveying your research ideas,  summarizing past work, making clear diagrams, showing experimental results and avoiding common errors in paper-writing, etc. To illustrate these tips, examples are quoted from many nicely (and not so nicely) written research papers. 

These tips are useful for writing a research paper or thesis, and may be useful even for making a power point presentation. While some of the points may be specific to speaker's research area and experience, most points are expected to be useful for any researcher  regardless of his/her research area. This talk is especially useful for beginning researchers.
