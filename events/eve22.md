**Abstract:**

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency developed (in 2008) with the objective of decentralizing control over currency. Bitcoin has started a revolution in distributed computing where trust in the overall system is achieved without placing much trust at any single entity in the system. Bitcoin system is realized by a clever combination of cryptography, P2P networking, distributed consensus and fault tolerant computing. However being a public network, bitcoin was not considered to be of much use to organizations where permissions of various entities play a vital role. However, the core concepts underlying the bitcoin system were found to be very useful for general systems. Thus blockchain technology was born. Ethereum, another public system and cryptocurrency, demonstrated how general-purpose distributed computing can be achieved through smart contracts on the blockchain technology. Finally, the permissioned / consortium blockchain technology was born for the consumption of large organizations, where the participating entities are assigned specific roles and responsibilities. In this talk we shall explore the features of various flavours of blockchain technology including cryptocurrencies.
