##### **Seminar on "Introduction to CUDA" by Dr Sparsh Mittal**  
**Title:**Introduction to CUDA  
**Speaker:** Dr Sparsh Mittal  
**Date:** 7th Sept 2017 (Thursday)  
**Venue:** Auditorium  
**Timings:** 12:00 to 13:30  
 
**Abstract:** Dr Sparsh Mittal will present a seminar on "Introduction to CUDA: a programming language for GPUs". The presentation will start with a brief introduction to GPU (graphics processing unit) and the memory address spaces in GPUs. CUDA programming will be illustrated through hello world program, scalar/vector addition program, and matrix multiplication program using global memory vs shared memory. Further, the use of threads/blocks, shared memory and thread synchronization using barrier in CUDA will be discussed through programs. 
The presentation will be useful for those interested in using GPUs for accelerating their workloads. 
 
**Prerequisites:** Attendees must have experience with C/C++. It will be helpful if the attendees know about the simple 2D matrix multiplication code and the following commands in C: malloc(), free(), memcpy(). However, experience with GPU, graphics-programming or parallel programming is not required.
