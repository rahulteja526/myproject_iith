**Title:** A special Lecture on Quantum Networking by Prof. Rodney Van Meter  
**Speaker:**  Prof. Rodney Van Meter  
**Host Faculty:**  Dr. Kotaro Kataoka  
**Room No:** 221 A-Block  
**Time:** 2:30 PM to 4:30 PM  
 
**Lecture 1: Analyzing Applications for Quantum Repeater Networks**

I divide the applications of quantum communications into three categories: quantum cryptographic functions, quantum sensor networks, and distributed quantum computation. Some of these functions are drop-in replacements for existing, classical functionality, with additional, desirable characteristics. At least one of the most exciting is an entirely new capability brought by quantum computation. In this talk, I will discuss the demands that quantum key distribution, quantum Byzantine agreement, quantum interferometry, and blind quantum computation will make on large-scale quantum repeater networks. We will sketch out an evolutionary path for the technology as repeater networks take on increasingly demanding applications.

**Lecture 2: Designing a Quantum Internet**

Over the last two years, tremendous experimental progress on quantum repeaters has been made.  Many theoretical designs for quantum repeaters exist, but have not been developed into concrete engineering designs suitable for implementation in real-world environments, with heterogeneous technologies and many organizations involved.  Our goal is to lead toward interoperable quantum networks and ultimately standardization, by taking into account the many real-world operational factors that do not occur in laboratory experiments or basic simulations.  These factors include heterogeneity of technology, misbehaving equipment, security concerns, and the need for privacy in network operations, as currently run on the classical Internet.  We also aim to integrate Quantum Internet services into classical Internet services.  In this talk, I will discuss several of the key questions in designing a complete Quantum Internet and present some of our recent results.

**Speaker's Bio:**

Rodney Van Meter received a B.S. in engineering and applied science from the California Institute of Technology in 1986, an M.S. in computer engineering from the University of Southern California in 1991, and a Ph.D. in computer science from Keio University in 2006. His current research centers on quantum computer architecture and quantum networking.  Other research interests include storage systems, networking, and post-Moore's Law computer architecture.  He is now an Associate Professor of Environment and Information Studies at Keio University's Shonan Fujisawa Campus.  Dr. Van Meter is a member of AAAS, ACM and IEEE.
