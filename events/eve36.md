##### **Invited Talk by Mr. Manohar Paluri from Facebook AI Research (Menlo Park, USA) on Computer Vision @ Facebook**
**Title:**  Computer Vision @ Facebook  
**Speaker:** Mr. Manohar Paluri from Facebook AI Research (Menlo Park, USA)  
**Host Faculty:** Dr. Vineeth N Balasubramanian  
**Room No:** 416(A-block)  
**Time:** 14:00 -15:00  
 
**Abstract:**  
Over the past 5 years the community has made significant strides in the field of Computer Vision. Thanks to large scale datasets, specialized computing in form of GPUs and many breakthroughs in modeling better ​ vision​  architectures Computer Vision systems in the wild at scale are becoming a reality. At Facebook AI Research we want to embark on the journey of making breakthroughs in the field of AI and using them for the benefit of connecting people and helping remove barriers for communication. In that regard Computer Vision plays a significant role as the media content coming to Facebook is ever increasing and building models that understand this content is crucial in achieving our mission of connecting everyone. In this talk I will ​c​over how we think about problems related to Computer Vision at Facebook and touch various aspects related to supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised learning. I will ​highlight  various research efforts involving representation learning ​, as well as some large scale applications​,​and talk about limitations of  ​existing  systems  ​t​o motivate  ​further research to tackle these problems
