**Title:** Hierarchical key agreement schemes for wireless ad-hoc networks: special focus on lightweight protocols  
**Speaker:** Dr. Pinaki Sarkar, NISER, Bhubaneshwar  
**Host Faculty:** Dr. Srijith P.K.  
**Room No:** 118 (A-block)  
**Time:** 16:00  

**Abstract:**

Key agreement is a fundamental functionality that allows participant entities to agree on symmetric secrets. These secrets can be later used for various cryptographic purposes. We review prominent key agreement schemes meant for wireless ad-hoc networks; specially in hierarchical settings. Thereby we zoom in on the desired design criteria of such schemes (Gennaro et al. 2008). Their splendid construction have certain shortcomings and fails to achieve all criteria set by them. This leads us to look into their construction closely and successfully address several issues. To this end, we conduct a survey of lightweight key management scheme before use of an appropriate one(s) in our construction. We conclude by pointing out that several works claim to propose improvements on this scheme of Gennaro et al. 2008. However most of these schemes suffer from security issues. A closer look at their proof of security yields loopholes that we rectify in our proof of security.
