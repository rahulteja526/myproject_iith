Invited Talk by Prof. Ajoy K Datta from University of Nevada Las Vegas on A Self-Stabilizing Minimal K-Grouping Algorithm
Title:  A Self-Stabilizing Minimal K-Grouping Algorithm
Speaker: Prof. Ajoy K Datta
Host Faculty: Dr. Sathya Peri
Room No: 220 (A-block)
Time:11:00 -12:00 
 
**Abstract:**

We present a silent self-stabilizing minimal k-grouping algorithm for an arbitrary network where the processes have unique ID's. We present a new technique to compose self-stabilizing algorithms, called loop composition.  We use this technique to design a silent self-stabilizing minimal k-grouping algorithm for an arbitrary network where the processes have unique ID's.  

After the talk from 12 to 1 pm, the speaker will discuss about the opportunities for prospective graduate studies at Computer Science Department in University of Nevada Las Vegas. All interested are welcome to attend the talk.
