Abstract:
In our increasingly interconnected world, security and privacy attacks on governments, organizations, as well as individuals are becoming commonplace. In the first half of the talk, I will describe some of the most important cyber-security threats, and security and privacy solutions today. 
In the later half of the talk, I will focus on emerging Bitcoin and blockchain technologies. In particular, I will first provide a brief introduction to the concept of blockchains and describe permisssioned and permissionless blockchains. I will then demonstrate their applicability and capabilities using two interesting smart contracts for penalizing equivocation and non-disclosure agreements (NDAs).
