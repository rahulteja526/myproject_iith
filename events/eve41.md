##### **Invited Talk by Dr. Ramesh Peri from Intel on Intel® Software tools: Faster Code … Faster**
**Title:** Intel® Software tools: Faster Code … Faster  
**Speaker:** Dr. Ramesh Peri  
**Host Faculty:** Dr. Sathya Peri  
**Room No:** 415, Academic Block-A  
**Time:** 14:00  
 
**Abstract:**  
Your software needs to run faster. It performs tasks that need to get done sooner, not later―including big data analytics, image analysis, machine learning applications, time-critical financial analysis, and simulations. Intel® Parallel Studio XE is a software development suite that helps boost application performance by taking advantage of the ever-increasing processor core count and vector register width available in Intel® Xeon® processors, Intel® Xeon Phi™ processors and coprocessors, and other compatible processors. In this talk I will give a brief introduction to various tools available in Parallel Studio with special focus on Vtune performance analysis tool which gives deep insights into how software executes on a processor.

**Speaker's Bio:**

Ramesh is architect of IoT Devkit and Performance analysis tools at Intel, working on compilers, debuggers, and profilers for Intel datacenter/mobile/IoT platforms. He is an expert in mobile/IoT platforms and spent over two decades working on a number of processors that include DSPs, micro-controllers, and a variety of application processors based on many different kinds of architectures. Ramesh has been at the forefront of getting Intel platforms into the embedded space, and worked with a number of OEMs and ODMs for optimizing the platforms for power and performance. He holds a Ph.D in computer science from the University of Virginia(USA), an MTech from IIT Kanpur (India), and a BS from REC Warangal (India). Prior to Intel, Ramesh worked at Hewlett Packard, Lucent and Panasonic.
