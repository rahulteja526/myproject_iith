##### **Invited Talk by Albert Greenberg,CVP for Microsoft Azure Networking on RDMA at Scale**
**Title:** RDMA at Scale  
**Speaker:** Albert Greenberg  
**Host Faculty:** Dr. Antony Franklin  
**Room No:** 118, Academic Block-A  
**Time:** 16:00  
 
**Abstract:**  
In this talk Albert is going to share how RDMA over commodity Ethernet is used at scale. He is going to cover how RDMA is used to achieve network latency reduction, no packet loss due to network congestion, achieving high throughput with low CPU overhead in massively parallel computer clusters. 

**Speaker's Bio:**

Albert Greenberg is the CVP for Microsoft Azure Networking, leading software and hardware development and engineering for all Microsoft Azure, including all Microsoft first and third parties, and encompassing physical data center, regional and wide area networking, host networking datapath, virtual networking, virtual appliances, hybrid networking, network security, network services, network distributed systems, optical networking, network reconfigurable hardware and device firmware, network analytics, edge/CDN networks and services. Azure is built on SDN principles, which the team pioneered as the inevitable and right way to scale the cloud.  Major offices for Azure networking are in Redmond, Beijing, Dublin and Hyderabad, all working to transform all elements of networking for the cloud: controlled by software, low cost, high performance, super reliable, secure and automated. Within Azure, founded and led the network virtualization, datapath and physical data center network teams in Azure, as well as other teams in networking and monitoring. Worked in Microsoft Research to invent and prototype the data center networking technologies now widely deployed in Microsoft services and products, such as Virtual Layer-2 (VL2), Virtual Networks (VNets), Load Balancing (Ananta), Data Center TCP (DCTCP). Joined Microsoft from Bell Labs and AT&T Labs Research, where he was an AT&T Fellow and Executive Director, and where he helped build the systems and tools for engineering and managing AT&Tâ€™s networks. IEEE Kobayashi Award winner, ACM Fellow, ACM Sigcomm Award winner, ACM Test of Time Paper Award winner, National Academy of Engineering member.
