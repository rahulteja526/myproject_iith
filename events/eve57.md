##### **Invited Talk by Dr. Naresh Manwani on Learning in presence of noise**
**Title:** Learning in presence of noise  
**Speaker:** Dr. Naresh Manwani.  
**Host Faculty:** Dr.Subrahmanyam Kalyanasundaram  
**Room No:** 
**Time:** 14:30 -15:30  

**Abstract:**

In many applications, the training data is corrupted with label noise. Many standard algorithms such as SVM, logistic regression etc. perform poorly in the presence of label noise. We investigate the robustness of risk minimization to label noise. We prove a sufficient condition on a loss function for the risk minimization under that loss to be tolerant to uniform label noise. We show that the 0–1 loss, sigmoid loss, ramp loss and probit loss satisfy this condition. Though none of the standard convex loss functions satisfy it. We also prove that, by choosing a sufficiently large value of a parameter in the loss function, the sigmoid loss, ramp loss and probit loss can be made tolerant to nonuniform label noise also if we can assume the classes to be separable under noise-free data distribution. Through extensive empirical studies, we show that risk minimization under the 0–1 loss, the sigmoid loss and the ramp loss has much better robustness to label noise when compared to the SVM algorithm.
