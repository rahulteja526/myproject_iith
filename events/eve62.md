##### **Invited Talk by Dr. Mukesh Saini:"Automatic Video Mashup Techniques for Multimedia Systems".**
**Title:** Automatic Video Mashup Techniques for Multimedia Systems  
**Speaker:** Dr. Mukesh Saini  
**Host Faculty:** Dr.Bheemarjuna Reddy Tamma  
**Room No:** 111  
**Time:** 15:00  

**Abstract:**

In a video mashup system, multiple videos are combined to produce a single representative video. The output video can be built based on different criteria depending on the application requirement. I will present three mashup techniques in this talk. In the first technique, we combine different mobile-recorded videos of live performances to produce MTV style videos for broadcasting and sharing. The shot transitions are learned from professionally edited videos. In the second approach, we create video mashups for security operators for dynamic load sharing in a multi-camera and multi-operator scenario.Finally, I will present a technique to create low-resolution mashup from single high definition video for surveillance through handheld devices.

**Speaker's Bio:**

My research focus is broadly on innovative use and design of image processing and machine learning algorithms for multimedia systems, with specialization in Big data analysis and presentation. Areas of my recent work include automatic movie making and privacy-aware video surveillance. In addition, I am also exploring multimedia techniques to solve various problems in the emerging area of Internet of Vehicles.

I obtained my Master of Technology (M. Tech) in Electronics Design and Technology from Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, in 2006 and PhD in Computer Science from School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Singapore in 2012 respectively. Currently I am a postdoctoral associate at University of Ottawa/New York University Abu Dhabi. I have played roles of Reviewer, TPC member, Tutorial organizer, and Panellist for various reputed conferences and journals.
