##### **InvitedTalk by Dr. Manish Gupta :"Community-based outlier detection from networks"**
**Title:** Community-based outlier detection from networks  
**Speaker:** Dr. Manish Gupta  
**Host Faculty:** Dr. Vineeth N Balasubramanian  
**Venue:** Room No 121  
**Time:** 15:00 hrs

**Abstract:**

​​​Closely related objects that share the same properties or interests form a community. Outlier detection in information networks can reveal important anomalous and interesting behaviors that are not obvious if community information is ignored. Also, people and objects usually evolve synchronously together with their communities. It is interesting to identify "anti-social" or abnormal individuals/groups or trend setters that do not follow their corresponding groups' evolutionary regularity. In this talk, I will discuss methods to identify community outliers in three settings: 1. Community Outliers given a single snapshot of a network [1]; 2. Evolutionary Community Outliers (ECOutliers) given two snapshots of a temporal network [2]; and 3. Community Trend Outliers (CTOutliers) given multiple time snapshots [3].
