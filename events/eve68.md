##### **Invited Talk by Prof.Rodney Van Meter on"Networks of Networks of Quantum Repeaters".**
**Title:** Networks of Networks of Quantum Repeaters  
**Speaker:** Rodney Van Meter, Keio University  
**Host Faculty:** Dr. M V Panduranga Rao  
**Venue:** Room No. 123  
**Time:** 14:30 hrs  

**Abstract:**

Quantum networks will improve the security of classical communications, allow a quantum client to request that a quantum server compute a function without disclosing anything to the server, and improve the sensitivity of scientific instruments. These networks will require boxes known as quantum repeaters.  Experimental progress toward quantum repeaters is moving at a  tremendous rate, and theorists have proposed half a dozen approaches to managing errors to create high-fidelity entanglement along a chain of repeaters.  The next frontier is extending from one-dimensional chains of repeaters to complex topologies. I will give an overview of applications of quantum networks, then discuss the daunting challenge of creating networks of networks -- a true quantum Internet, heterogeneous in both physical technology and error management scheme.

**Brief Bio of the Speaker:**

Rodney Van Meter received a B.S. in engineering and applied science from the California Institute of Technology in 1986, an M.S. in computer engineering from the University of Southern California in 1991, and a Ph.D. in computer science from Keio University in 2006.His current research centers on quantum computer architecture and quantum networking.  Other research interests include storage systems, networking, and post-Moore's Law computer architecture.  He is now an Associate Professor of Environment and Information Studies at Keio University's Shonan Fujisawa Campus.  Dr. Van Meter is a member of AAAS, ACM and IEEE.
