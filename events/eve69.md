**Time:** 15:00 hrs  

**Abstract:​​​**

Recognizing scene text is a challenging problem, even more so than the recognition of scanned documents. Given the rapid growth of camera-based applications readily available on  obile phones, understanding scene text is more important than ever.One could, for instance, foresee an application to answer questions such as,“What does this sign say?". This is related to the problem of Optical Character Recognition (OCR), which has a long history in the computer vision community. However, the success of OCR systems is largely restricted to text from scanned  ocuments. Scene text exhibits a large variability in appearances, and can prove to be challenging even for the state-of-the-art OCR methods. Many scene understanding methods recognize objects and regions like roads, trees,​sky in the image successfully, but tend to ignore the text on the sign board.​In this talk I will talk about various techniques proposed by us to fill this gap in  understanding the scene. ​Parts  of this talk have been appeared at CVPR'12, ICCV'13, BMVC'12 and ICDAR'11 ​.​
