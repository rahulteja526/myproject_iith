**Abstract:**

This talk offers an overview and introduction to Machine Learning with an emphasis on Enterprise applications and reasons why ML is currently a practice of great interest.  It will then introduce key methods of ML including Classification, Clustering and Association Rules, with examples from my teaching of this course.  It then presents 6 different applied analytics methods which were developed for Cloud (SaaS) Analytics and Visualization of complex systems.
