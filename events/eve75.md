##### **Invited talk by Dr. Bruhadeshwar on Privacy Preserving Quantification of Cross-Domain Network Reachability**
**Title Of the talk:** Privacy Preserving Quantification of Cross-Domain Network Reachability  
**Speaker:** Dr. Bruhadeshwar  
**Date &Time:** Wednesday Nov 5, 2014 3.00 pm  
**Venue:** Room no. 123  

**Abstract:**

Network reachability is an important characteristic for understanding end-to-end network behavior and helps in detecting violations of security policies across the network. While quantifying network reachability within one administrative domain is a difficult problem in itself, performing the same computation across a network spanning multiple administrative domains presents a novel challenge. The problem of quantifying network reachability across multiple administrative domains is more difficult because the privacy of security policies of individual domains is a serious concern and needs to be protected through this process. Towards this, we propose the first cross-domain privacy-preserving protocol for quantifying network reachability. Our protocol constructs equivalent representations of the Access Control List (ACL) rules and determines network reachability while preserving the privacy of the individual ACLs. This protocol can accurately determine the network reachability along a network path through different administrative domains. We have implemented and evaluated our protocol on both real and synthetic ACLs. Our protocol is efficient and can be deployed in real-time for large enterprise networks. 

**Speaker Profile:**

Bruhadeshwar has received his B.E. (ECE) from Osmania University, Hyderabad in 1998; M.S. (Electrical and Computer Engineering) in 2000; and PhD from the Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering at Michigan State University, East Lansing, in 2005. His thesis topic was: "Adaptive Key Management Algorithms for Secure Group Communication". He has worked as an Assistant Professor at the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad from 2005-2014, and is a Visiting Scholar at Nanjing University, China since January 2014. His research interests are in the areas of data privacy, network security, key management, malware analysis and cloud computing, with around 30 peer-reviewed publications in these areas. He has also served on the TPC of international conferences like, ICDCN2010-11, ICISS 2006 to 2013, IEEE ICCCN 2014, ACM SIN 2012-14, IEEEICNP 2014 and national conferences like ACM Compute 2013, NCC 2010 and Hack. In 2009. He has served as reviewer for several journals from the IEEE Transactions series and Elsevier journals in the areas of distributed systems and security. Since 2011 he has been guiding CDAC-Mohali on the development of algorithms and techniques for use in Honeypots and malware collection and analysis.
