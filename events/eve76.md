**Venue:** Room no. 205  

**Abstract:**

Internet traffic is increasing rapidly at an annual growth rate of 35% with aggregate traffic exceeding several Exabyte’s per month. The traffic is also becoming heterogeneous in bandwidth and quality-of-service (QoS) requirements with growing popularity of cloud computing, video-on-demand (VoD), e-science, etc. Hybrid circuit/packet networks which can jointly support circuit and packet services along with the adoption of high-bit-rate transmission systems form an attractive solution to address the traffic growth. 10 Gbps and 40 Gbps transmission systems are widely deployed in telecom backbone networks such as Comcast, AT&T, etc., and network operators are considering migration to 100 Gbps and beyond. In this talk I will discuss robust architectures, capacity migration strategies, and novel service frameworks for next-generation telecom networks. In this talk, we study two types of hybrid circuit/packet networks: a) IP-over-WDM networks, in which the packet (IP) network is overlaid on top of the circuit (optical WDM) network and b) Hybrid networks in which the circuit and packet networks are deployed side by side such as US DoE’s ESnet. We investigate techniques to dynamically migrate capacity between the circuit and packet sections by exploiting traffic variations over a day. The proposed schemes are also implemented as path computation engines (PCE) in Berkeley Lab’s ESnet network scheduling software, called OSCARS. Mixed-line-rate (MLR) networks supporting 10/40/100 Gbps on the same fiber are becoming increasingly popular. Services that accept degradation in bandwidth, latency, jitter, etc. under failure scenarios for lower cost are known as degraded services. I will discuss degradation services in the context of MLR networks which are crucial during failures in the network. To cope with traffic growth, network operators need to deploy equipment at periodic time intervals, and this is known as the multi-period planning and upgrade problem. I will discuss three important multi-period planning approaches, namely incremental planning, all-period planning, and two-period planning with mixed line rates. I will also discuss my experience in smart-grid networks and my plans for future research.
