##### **Invited talk by Sandip Chakraborty onData Rate Adaptation in Multi-Rate Mesh Networks: Path Length vs Network Contention**
**Title Of the Talk:** Data Rate Adaptation in Multi-Rate Mesh Networks: Path Length vs Network Contention  
**Speaker:** Sandip Chakraborty  
**Date &Time:** Wednesday April 9, 2014 2pm â€“ 3pm  
**Venue:** Room No-123  
 
**Abstract:**

Most of the commercially available wireless routers are equipped with multi-rate support to adopt physical data rates based on the channel condition fluctuations. The recent studies in multi-rate support have shown that low data rates are more effective when the channel error rate is high. Because of the physical layer modulation and signal decoding issues, low data rates are sustainable for long transmission ranges. Therefore, for multi-hop mesh networks, low data rates may scale down the end-toend path length towards the destination in terms of number of hops, resulting in less end-to-end forwarding delay. However, for a network with high traffic load, long transmission ranges may increase contention for channel access among the contending neighbors. In this talk, I'll first discuss about the trade-off among data rate, end-to-end path length and network contention in a multi-rate mesh network built over the IEEE 802.11s specifications. From the observations of the theoretical analysis, I'll discuss about a distributed and localized rate adaptation scheme for IEEE 802.11s mesh networks, by augmenting the standard peer selection, channel access and forwarding protocols. I'll also bring a performance comparison of the proposed rate adaptation protocol with other existing rate adaptation schemes. Finally, I'll conclude my talk with future direction of researches in multi-rate mesh network, and a general discussions of future prospects of the wireless mesh networking technology.
