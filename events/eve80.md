##### **Invited talk by Dr. Sunil Malipatlolla on Trusted Computing**  
**Title Of the Talk:** Trusted Computing  
**Speaker:** Dr. Sunil Malipatlolla  
**Date &Time:** Wednesday Feb 26, 2014 2pm – 3pm  
**Venue:** Room No-LH1

**Abstract:**  

Trusted computing is gaining an increasing acceptance in the industry and finding its way to cloud computing. With this penetration, the question arises whether the concept of hardwired security modules will cope with the increasing sophistication and security requirements of future IT systems and the ever expanding threats and violations. So far, embedding cryptographic hardware engines into the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) has been regarded as a security feature. However, new developments in cryptanalysis, sidechannel analysis, and the emergence of novel powerful computing systems, such as quantum computers, can render this approach useless. Given that, the question arises: Do we have to throw away all TPMs and lose the data protected by them, if someday a cryptographic engine on the TPM becomes insecure? To address this question, we present a novel architecture called Sustainable Trusted Platform Module (STPM), which guarantees a secure update of the TPM cryptographic engines without compromising the system’s trustworthiness. The STPM architecture has been implemented as a proofof-concept on top of a Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA platform, demonstrating the test cases with an update of the fundamental hash and asymmetric engines of the TPM. 

**Speaker Profile:**  

Sunil Malipatlolla is working as a scientific researcher at OFFIS - Institute for Information Technology, Oldenburg, Germany, since August 2012. His fields of interest are secure embedded system design and FPGA-based system design. He received his M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees, both in computer science, from University of ErlangenNürnberg, Germany and Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany in years 2008 and 2013 respectively. Before pursuing higher studies in Germany, he worked as a lecturer at TRR College of Engineering, Hyderabad, India. He has been awarded with Siemens master scholarship and German governmental doctoral scholarship for his higher studies in Germany. He received B.Tech degree in electronics and communication engineering from Dr. B.V.Raju Institute of Technology (affiliated to JNTU Hyderabad), India in 2004.
