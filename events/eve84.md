##### **Invited Talk by Dr. Kalyan Sasidhar on Indoor Localization and Navigation using Smartphones**
**Title Of the Talk:** Indoor Localization and Navigation using Smartphones  
**Speaker:** Dr. Kalyan Sasidhar  
**Date&Time:** Monday, 11 Nov 2013 14:30-15:30  
**Venue:** Room No-120  

**Abstract:**  

Fine grained localization is extremely important to accurately locate a user indoors. Although innovative solutions have already been proposed, there is no solution that is universally accepted, easily implemented, user centric and most importantly work in the absence of GSM coverage or WiFi availability. By exploiting the uniqueness of ambient magnetic fields collected using a smartphoneâ€™s magnetometer, a system is developed that can accurately identify the location irrespective of the user walking. We further enhance the localization system into an infrastructure free crowdsensing based navigation system that first builds floor maps and then provides navigational instructions using the floor map. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the system requires almost zero calibration, delivers satisfactory localization accuracy, has a significantly lower energy consumption, and but not least is easily accessible to the general public.


**Speaker Profile:**  

Dr.Kalyan Sasidhar is currently an assistant professor at Amrita University in the Wireless Networks and Applications department. Prior to joining here, he was a postdoctoral researcher at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. He obtained a PhD in Computer Science from the University of North Texas, USA in December 2011. His research is primarily system design using smartphones, developing solutions for problems in the mobile and pervasive computing domain. He currently has 10 publications in IEEE and ACM.
