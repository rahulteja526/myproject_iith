* **How many times admissions happen in a year?**

##### Guide allocation {#guide}

**Note:** Allocation of a guide to a student depends on several factors, e.g., student choice, faculty choice, availability of open position with a faculty and other policies/constraints, etc. Hence, even though the department tries to make its best effort to accommodate the student's choice, the department cannot always guarantee that a particular guide will be allocated to a student.

* **How is the guide decided for a student in M.Tech (TA) program?**  
  M.Tech is an MHRD-funded program. The guide selection generally happens in the second semester, based on the factors, such as student choice, faculty choice, availability of open position with a faculty, department policies etc.

* **How is the guide decided for a student in M.Tech (RA) program?**  
  M.Tech (RA) is a project-funded program and hence, the faculty executing that funded-project is the guide for the student admitted under that project. As such, the guide is allocated right in the beginning of the first semester and there is no possibility of changing the guide/project at a later stage. In the admission process, before the interview, the applicants are informed about the projects/research-areas where M.Tech (RA) positions are available. Then, students' preferences for the projects are collected. Based on it and other factors (e.g., faculty choices), a student is admitted under a certain project.

* **How is the guide decided for a student in the PhD program?**  
  A PhD position can be either MHRD-funded or project-funded. The allocation of a guide depends on several factors, as stated above. The department will explain the guide allocation policy to the applicants before the interview process.


##### After joining {#postjoin}

* **Can I convert from M.Tech (RA) or M.Tech (TA) to PhD?**  
  Yes, depending on the availability of funds/positions

* **Can I convert from PhD to M.Tech (RA)?**  
  This is not possible

* **Does IITH has an on-campus school, where the kids of students can study?**  
  Yes, for school education of kids of IITH faculty/staff/students, there is an on-campus DAV school for classes PreKG to 6th.

  - An MTech TA needs to perform 8 hour of TA duties. An MTech RA performs RA duties, but no TA duties.
  - The stipend of MTech RA is higher than that of MTech TA
* Similarities:
  - Both programs have same number of total credits 
  - At the completion of the program, both get the same degree “MTech in CSE”. The only point to note is that for M.Tech (RA), the transcript will provide the grade sheet for 6 semesters instead of 4 semesters


### Questions related to M.Tech (TA) {#questmtechta}
* **Can I convert from M.Tech (RA) to M.Tech (TA)?**

* **What are the TA responsibilities?**  
  An M.Tech (TA) is expected to perform 8 hours of TA duties per week

* **What is the degree that will be awarded to the student who completes MTech in Machine Learning (ML) program?**  
  For the students admitted in CSE department, the degree will be "Master of Technology in CSE with specialization in Machine Learning." For the students admitted in EE (electrical engineering) department, the degree will be "Master of Technology in EE with specialization in Machine Learning."


### Questions related to M.Tech (RA) {#questmtechra}
* **What are the highlights of M.Tech (RA)? Why should I join M.Tech (RA) program?**
  - RA program is ideal for students who are not sure about doing a PhD, but still want to get exposure to research
  - Students in RA program complete courses with slow pace, which allows them to start research right from first semester. Also,    the students have no TA responsibility
  - The duration is RA program is fixed (3 year), thus, there is surety of time-bound graduation
  - The stipend of RA program is higher than that of TA program
  - Our RA program has been quite successful and our previous batch of students have had very good publication/placement record.

* **After completing M.Tech (RA), is there an obligation to join the company which sponsored it?**  
  No

* **If I am unable to complete my research target in 3 year, is my graduation delayed?**  
  No. M.Tech (RA) is a program with time-bound graduation

### Questions related to PhD {#questmtechphd}
* **Can I join PhD directly after a B.Tech degree**  
  Yes

* **How long does a typical Ph.D. take?**  
  4 - 5 years depending upon various factors.

* **Does having an M.Tech degree reduces the time required to complete PhD?**  
  It depends on many factors, such as alignment of the research area in M.Tech and PhD, student’s progress etc.  

* **For how long is the MHRD funding available?**

  Yes, it is possible to do so after taking the approvals.

* **Can a part-time PhD student convert to full-time PhD program?**  
  This is not allowed.

* **What are the differences and similarities in the full-time and part-time PhD program?**  
* **Similarities**
  - The credit/graduation requirement is same for both
  - Similar to full-time PhD students, the part-time PhD students need to register every semester.
  - Note that there are no separate classes for part-time PhD programs, thus, they need to take the course-work with other students in the institute. Also, it is not possible to shift the class schedules for part-time PhD students.  
* **Differences**
  - The students enrolled in full-time PhD program receive financial support (excluding the sponsored students), whereas students enrolled in part-time program do not get financial support
  - At the time of admission, the part-time PhD students need to provide a letter from their employer that the employer will approve a leave for completing the PhD course-work.
  - The part-time PhD program is generally useful for students who are currently employed elsewhere. Hence, after doing their course-work, they have the flexibility of doing their PhD and the job in parallel, by consultation with the adviser. The students are still required to fulfill the PhD requirement, e.g., register every semester, publish research papers and meet the adviser/doctoral committee when required. Also, the students need to provide a letter from the employer that they are employed in their organization.

* **Are there any entrance exam or interview for getting into the Ph.D. programme?**  
  The department may conduct both entrance test and interview. See this page for a sample exam paper. The test will have the syllabus similar to GATE CS. Interview is generally taken on the field of candidate’s interest.

* **I have done M.Tech from an IIT.  Does it help?**  
  Subject to the approval of CSE department post-graduate committee (DPGC), your coursework requirement may be reduced. Please contact the DPGC.

* **How is the research area decided?**  
  Research area will be decided based on the student’s interest and availability of faculty in the area.
