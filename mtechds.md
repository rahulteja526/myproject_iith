From August 2018 semester, CSE department is offering a new MTech programme known as MTech in Data Science (MDS). It is an extension to the Executive MTech in Data Science (EMDS) programme and is equivalent to regular MTech programme. This [FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1waV7SpQX8oteEsNyj5K44zINKDVeKhzn0yQTXZJbeMk/edit?usp=sharing) contains curriculum, syllabus and other details about the MDS programme.

It is a self-paced program of 48 credits that can be taken over 3-5 years. Similar to EMDS programme, students will do 24 credits of coursework in the first two years. In the third year, they would two Capstone projects of 12 credits each. If a student is not interested in doing the 24 credits of Capstone projects, then he/she can graduate with the Executive MTech in Data Science (EMDS) degree. 

Students have the option of taking lesser number of courses in different semesters and complete the course requirement in 2-4 years.  The classes will be held over the weekends or other timings suitable for working professionals. Capstone Projects can be taken only after the course requirement is complete. More details can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1waV7SpQX8oteEsNyj5K44zINKDVeKhzn0yQTXZJbeMk/edit?usp=sharing).
