* In the previous rounds of admission, only shortlisted candidates were invited to appear in written-test. However, in this round of admissions (January 2019), any candidate who has applied for PhD and paid the fee is eligible to appear for the written-test.
* Shortlisting based on eligibility criterion will be done after the written-test.

* No relaxation in eligibility criterion will be given in any case. A student found not meeting eligibility criterion will not be interviewed/selected or given any travelling allowance, regardless of his/her score in the written-test.

**As for the percentage to GPA conversion, the following rule applies.**
1. If candidate's university has provided GPA corresponding to the percentage on the transcript, or if his/her university prescribes some formula for conversion, then, that will apply. This formula should be mentioned clearly on University website and/or candidate's transcript. 
2. Otherwise, the following formula, will apply: GPA = percentage/10  
If the GPA of the candidate is not in the scale of 10 but in the scale of K (e.g., 4 or 8), then:  
GPA = GPAOnScaleK*10/(K)  
Here, GPAOnScaleK is candidate's GPA on the scale of K.  
For GPA, rounding-off will not be done. For example, if a candidate's GPA is 6.98 and the GPA criterion is 7.00, then, the candidate will not be considered as eligible.

##### **GENERAL INFORMATION** {#general}

Computer Science and Engineering department invites applications from motivated and research-oriented students for the Ph.D. program. IIT Hyderabad, one of the IITs established by the Govt of India in 2008, has quickly grown to be one of the best institutions for education and research in the country in a very short period. IIT Hyderabad has consistently ranked among top ten engineering institutes in India as per the NIRF ranking in last three years. Aided by visionary administration and world-class faculty, IIT Hyderabad is gradually carving out a name for itself among the other IITs, and is an exciting place to study and carry out research today. It has been operating from its permanent campus since October 2015, and has 13 departments with 172 faculty and more than 2000 students, with almost half of them being post-graduate students.

The CSE department at IITH is comprised of 57 PhD students and 19 young and dynamic faculty members. The department has already graduated 7 PhD students and some of them are pursuing Post-Doc at prestigious places such as University of Chicago, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and University of Quebec. Before joining IITH, the faculty members were affiliated with world class universities and industry such as University of Oxford, UCSD, Iowa State University, University of Melbourne, INRIA, Samsung, and Georgia Tech. Their research spans a wide variety of areas including algorithms, computational complexity, formal methods, constraint solving, program analysis, graph theory, networks and mobile systems, Internet of Things, big data, databases, parallel/distributed systems, compilers, VLSI, computer architecture, machine learning, and image/video processing. The faculty have received substantial sponsored research projects in the application domains of converged cloud radio access networks, big data analytics and visual intelligence, and have active research collaborations with various academic and industry partners such as Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Microsoft Research, IBM Research, Intel, AMD, INRIA, Eurecom, DRDO as well as University of Oxford, IISc and other IITs. Our faculty also have strong publication records in tier-1 venues such as VLDB, SIGMOD, POPL, KDD, CVPR, ACL, IEEE TPAMI, PR, IEEE TNNLS, etc.

**Why join CSE@ IITH for PhD?**

* A student joining as direct PhD has the option to get both MTech and PhD degrees, upon meeting the requirements and fulfilling required number of course credits. 
* The faculty members and students of the department have several [awards and honours](https://cse.iith.ac.in/index-q=Achievements-Awards.html) to their credit. 
* The department has a strong collaboration with Japanese universities/industries. Many of our research scholars have spent time in Japan as part of academic/cultural exchange programs.
* The department has state-of-the-art computational infrastructure for research.

##### **Financial Assistance** {#finance}

Full time PhD students are eligible to receive financial assistance through various avenues.

* MHRD Fellowships: As per current norms, MHRD fellowships provide monthly stipend of  ₹25000 for the first two years (at JRF level) and ₹28000 for the next three years (at SRF  level). There is a provision of 30% HRA in case IITH can not provide campus accommodation to the student.
* PM Fellowships: PM fellowships are very prestigious fellowships which pays double the amount as compared to MHRD fellowship. These fellowships are quite competitive and require an industry partner, where the student will be working on research problems that is of mutual interest to a faculty member and the industry partner. Please see [https://primeministerfellowshipscheme.in/](https://www.primeministerfellowshipscheme.in/) for more details.
* Visvesvaraya Fellowships: PhD students of CSE department can also apply for Visvesvaraya Fellowship which pays ₹31500 per month for the first two years of the program and ₹35000 per month. Additional 30% HRA is provided if applicable. It also has provision for some contingency funds.  At present, 16 of our research scholars are Visvesvaraya fellows. Please see [http://phd.medialabasia.in/fulltimephd.php](https://phd.medialabasia.in/fulltimephd.php) for more details about Visvesvaraya Fellowship.
* Industry fellowships: Companies such as Intel, Infosys, TCS, Google often provides fellowships for full time PhD students. Some of our PhD students have got TCS and Intel Fellowships. Getting such fellowships also adds a plus point in your CV. These fellowship amounts vary but usually provides similar monthly stipend as MHRD fellowships.
* Project funded fellowships: Faculty members of the department work on various research projects and students can be hired for doing research in a particular project. The fellowship amount remains the same as MHRD fellowship but an added advantage is that the research problems are clear from the beginning.
* The institute provides financial assistance to present their research papers in international and national venues during their PhD program.
